# 🧠 Planning & Lab Overview

## 📝 1. Objectives

The goal of this lab was to simulate a small enterprise Active Directory environment to sharpen my cybersecurity and IT administration skills. I focused on hands-on configuration of key services including:

- Domain Controller deployment using **Windows Server 2025**
- Client domain joining with **Windows 11 Pro**
- Implementation of **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** for security and user management
- Configuration of DNS, firewall rules, folder redirection, and login scripts
- Testing and troubleshooting AD-related issues
