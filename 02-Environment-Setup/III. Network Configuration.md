This section outlines the overall network configuration.

## Network Configuration
### Steps Completed:
1. **Set all VMs to "Internal Network" mode** in VirtualBox to isolate the AD lab from the internet

2. **Configured static IPs** on all VMs to maintain stable communication within the AD environment

3. **Tested network connectivity** between the server and both clients using ping

4. **Validated name resolution** (after DNS setup) to confirm proper hostname resolution in future phases
