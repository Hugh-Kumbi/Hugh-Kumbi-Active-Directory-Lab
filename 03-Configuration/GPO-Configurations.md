# 🔧 Group Policy Configuration

This document outlines the key **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** I created and linked to the domain to enforce security, user restrictions, and environment settings. These policies are critical for central management and enforcing compliance in a Windows enterprise environment.

## 🧱 1. Organizational Unit (OU) Structure

Before creating GPOs, I organized domain objects into appropriate **Organizational Units** for better control and delegation.

### OU Structure:
- `Domain Controllers`
- `Workstations`
- `AdminUsers`
- `StandardUsers`

## ⚙️ 2. GPO Creation and Linking

Created and linked GPOs to the appropriate OUs using the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**.

### GPOs Implemented:
| GPO Name                     | Linked To           | Purpose                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| USB Restriction Policy       | Workstations        | Disable removable storage               |
| RDP Restriction Policy       | Domain Controllers  | Allow RDP for Domain Admins only        |
| Password Policy              | Domain Root         | Enforce complex password rules          |
| Account Lockout Policy       | Domain Root         | Prevent brute-force attacks             |
| Audit Policy                 | Domain Root         | Track critical system/user activity     |
| Folder Redirection Policy    | StandardUsers       | Redirect user folders to server share   |
| Drive Mappings Policy        | StandardUsers       | Map network drives                      |
| Logon Scripts Policy         | StandardUsers       | Execute scripts at logon/logoff         |
| Firewall Policy              | Domain Root         | Harden network security                 |
| Service Configuration Policy | Domain Root         | Disable unnecessary services            |

## 🔁 3. GPO Enforcement & Inheritance

- Used **Enforced** flag for domain-wide security GPOs (e.g., Password Policy).
- Blocked inheritance on specific OUs where necessary to prevent unintended policy application.
- Used **WMI Filtering** and **Security Filtering** for targeted GPO deployment.

## 📤 4. GPO Replication Verification

Verified that GPOs were successfully replicated and applied:

### On Domain Controller:
```powershell
repadmin /syncall /AdeP
