# üîß Group Policy Configuration

This document outlines the key **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** I created and linked to the domain to enforce security, user restrictions, and environment settings. These policies are critical for central management and enforcing compliance in a Windows enterprise environment.

---

## üß± 1. Organizational Unit (OU) Structure

Before creating GPOs, I organized domain objects into appropriate **Organizational Units** for better control and delegation.

### OU Structure:
- `Domains`
  - `hughdomain.local`
- `AdminAccounts`
- `Domain Controllers`
- `Employees`
  - `Accounting`
  - `Customer Support`
  - `Finance`
  - `Human Resources`
  - `IT`
    - `ITSecurity`
    - `ITSupport` 
  - `Legal`
  - `Marketing`
  - `Operations`
  - `Product Management`
  - `Research`
  - `Sales`
- `Groups`
- `MeiVaultComputers`
- `MeiVaultServers`
- `ServiceAccounts`
- `Users`

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. GPO Creation and Linking

Created and linked GPOs to the appropriate OUs using the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**.

## üîÅ 3. GPO Enforcement & Inheritance

- Used **Enforced** flag for domain-wide security GPOs.
- Blocked inheritance on specific OUs where necessary to prevent unintended policy application.

## üì§ 4. GPO Replication Verification

Verified that GPOs were successfully replicated and applied:

### On Domain Controller:
- Checked Event Viewer for GroupPolicy logs under üìÇ `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > GroupPolicy`.
- Ran:
```powershell
repadmin /syncall /AdeP
```
