🛡 04-Group Policy & Security Configuration
In this phase, I implemented Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to centrally manage and enforce security settings, user restrictions, and desktop environments for domain-joined computers. These configurations are crucial for maintaining consistency, securing endpoints, and streamlining administrative tasks across the Active Directory domain.

🗂 Organizational Unit (OU) Structure
To apply GPOs effectively, I first organized the directory with logical OUs:

OU=Users – Contains all domain user accounts

OU=Computers – Contains all domain-joined Windows 11 clients

OU=Groups – Holds security and distribution groups

OU=IT and OU=Sales – Departmental OUs for targeted policies

⚙️ Key Group Policy Objects Implemented
🔒 1. Baseline Security Policy
Linked to: LAB.LOCAL domain root
Purpose: Establish a minimum security standard
Settings:

Account lockout threshold: 3 failed attempts

Lockout duration: 15 minutes

Password complexity: Enabled

Minimum password length: 12 characters

Disable guest account

🪟 2. Windows Desktop Hardening
Linked to: OU=Computers
Purpose: Restrict unnecessary features and tighten user access
Settings:

Disable Control Panel and Settings access

Remove Run and Command Prompt access

Disable Windows Store

Turn off USB storage access

Automatically lock workstation after 10 minutes of inactivity

🧑‍💼 3. Department-Specific GPOs
Linked to: OU=Sales and OU=IT
Purpose: Apply tailored configurations
Sales GPO Settings:

Map shared network drive (S:\Sales)

Apply custom desktop wallpaper
IT GPO Settings:

Enable Remote Desktop access

Install PowerShell modules via logon script

🛠 4. Software Restriction & App Control
Linked to: OU=Computers
Purpose: Prevent users from executing unknown or harmful software
Settings:

Block .exe files in %APPDATA%

Use Path Rules to whitelist approved software only

Enable SmartScreen filter in Microsoft Edge

🧪 GPO Testing & Verification
Used gpupdate /force to enforce policy updates

Ran gpresult /r and rsop.msc to verify applied policies

Logged in with test accounts in both OUs to confirm correct enforcement

Validated that restricted actions (e.g., USB access, Control Panel) were blocked

✅ Outcome
These policies established a secure and manageable environment within the AD domain. The GPO framework ensures:

Consistent user experience across departments

Hardened system configurations for all endpoints

Reduced risk of unauthorized access or malware execution
