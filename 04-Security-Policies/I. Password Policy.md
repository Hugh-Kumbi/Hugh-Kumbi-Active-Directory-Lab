# 🔐 Password Policy (Domain GPO)

This document outlines the **Password Policy** implemented through Group Policy to enforce strong password requirements in the domain. Password policies are essential for reducing the risk of unauthorized access through weak credentials.

---

## 📛 1. GPO Name

- **GPO Name:** Password Policy
- **Linked to:** hughdomain.local (domain root)

This policy was created using the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** and linked at the domain level to ensure that it applies uniformly to all domain user accounts.

## ⚙️ 2. Policy Settings

The following settings were configured under:<br />
📂 `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy`

| Setting                                         | Value                   |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Enforce password history**                    | 24 passwords remembered |
| **Maximum password age**                        | 90 days                 |
| **Minimum password age**                        | 30 day                   |
| **Minimum password length**                     | 12 characters           |
| **Password must meet complexity requirements**  | Enabled                 |
| **Store passwords using reversible encryption** | Disabled                |

These settings ensure users cannot reuse old passwords frequently, must use complex and lengthy passwords, and cannot store passwords insecurely.

## 📌 3. Purpose and Justification

### 🛡️ Why These Settings?

- **Password history** prevents reuse of recently used passwords.
- **Expiration** ensures users periodically change their passwords.
- **Complexity requirements** force users to use a mix of characters.
- **Minimum length** increases entropy and password strength.
- **Reversible encryption** is disabled to avoid plaintext storage.

These settings align with best practices and compliance requirements such as NIST and CIS Benchmarks.

## ✅ 4. Testing and Validation

Logged into a test account and attempted to change the password using a weak one — blocked by GPO.
- Verified GPO application using:
```powershell
gpresult /r
```
- Checked rsop.msc (Resultant Set of Policy) to confirm applied settings.
