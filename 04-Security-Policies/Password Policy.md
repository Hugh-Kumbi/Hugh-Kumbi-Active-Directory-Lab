# üîê Password Policy (Domain GPO)

This document outlines the **Password Policy** implemented through Group Policy to enforce strong password requirements in the domain. Password policies are essential for reducing the risk of unauthorized access through weak credentials.

## üìõ 1. GPO Name

- **GPO Name:** Domain Password Policy
- **Linked To:** hughdomain.local (domain root)

This policy was created using the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** and linked at the domain level to ensure that it applies uniformly to all domain user accounts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Policy Settings

The following settings were configured under:

üìÇ `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy`

| Setting                               | Value                |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Enforce password history              | 24 passwords         |
| Maximum password age                  | 90 days              |
| Minimum password age                  | 1 day                |
| Minimum password length               | 12 characters        |
| Password must meet complexity         | Enabled              |
| Store passwords using reversible encryption | Disabled         |

These settings ensure users cannot reuse old passwords frequently, must use complex and lengthy passwords, and cannot store passwords insecurely.

## üìå 3. Purpose and Justification

### üõ°Ô∏è Why These Settings?

- **Password history** prevents reuse of recently used passwords.
- **Expiration** ensures users periodically change their passwords.
- **Complexity requirements** force users to use a mix of characters.
- **Minimum length** increases entropy and password strength.
- **Reversible encryption** is disabled to avoid plaintext storage.

These settings align with best practices and compliance requirements such as NIST and CIS Benchmarks.

## ‚úÖ 4. Testing and Validation

- Logged into a test account and attempted to change the password using a weak one ‚Äî blocked by GPO.
- Verified GPO application using:
  
```powershell
gpresult /r
