# üåê DNS Configuration for Active Directory

This section documents the DNS setup and verification process that supports the Active Directory domain infrastructure. Proper DNS configuration ensures reliable name resolution for domain-joined devices and critical services like logon, replication, and Group Policy.

**9. Output From `nslookup` Commands For Hostname and IP Resolution:**

- Displays results from `nslookup` queries using both hostnames and IP addresses. Confirms that the DNS server correctly resolves internal domain names to IPs and supports reverse lookup functionality. This validates proper DNS integration with Active Directory services.
