# 🔧 Logon/Logoff Scripts Configuration

This section outlines the configuration of Logon and Logoff Scripts in Group Policy, which are used to automate tasks when users log on or log off from their workstations.

---

## 1. 📜 Creating Logon/Logoff Scripts

Logon and logoff scripts can be created and configured to run automatically whenever a user logs on or off the system. These scripts are typically used for environment setup, file mappings, network configurations, etc.

Once the scripts are created, they can be assigned through Group Policy, allowing them to be applied to users in specific OUs or security groups.
