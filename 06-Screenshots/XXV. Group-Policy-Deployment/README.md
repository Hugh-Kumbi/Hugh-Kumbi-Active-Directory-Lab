# ⚙️ Group Policy Deployment

This section explains the deployment process of Group Policies within the Active Directory environment to ensure configurations are applied consistently across client systems.

---

## 1. 🖥️ Deploying Group Policy to Organizational Units (OUs)

Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are deployed to specific Organizational Units (OUs) to apply settings to user and computer accounts. This ensures that policies are targeted to the right systems based on their location within Active Directory.

## 2. 🔄 GPO Inheritance and Filtering

Group Policy inheritance allows GPOs to be passed down from parent OUs to child OUs. However, inheritance can be blocked or filtered based on security group memberships or WMI filters.

## 3. 📜 Applying GPOs to Specific Security Groups

GPOs can be applied to specific security groups using Security Filtering. This allows you to target policies to certain users or computers within an OU, ensuring granular control over group policy application.

## 4. 🚀 Testing Group Policy Deployment

Before full deployment, test the applied GPO on a small set of machines or users to ensure that the policies are being enforced correctly. You can use the gpresult command to verify GPO application.

## 5. 🔧 Force Group Policy Update

Use the gpupdate command to immediately refresh and apply Group Policies on client systems. This is useful to test policies or when making changes that need to be reflected right away.

## 6. 📋 Group Policy Result with `gpresult`

The gpresult command shows a detailed report of applied GPOs for a user or computer. This tool helps verify that the correct policies are being applied and troubleshoot any issues.

## 7. 🖥️ Event Viewer Logs for Group Policy Application

Use the Event Viewer to check for logs that confirm Group Policy application. These logs provide detailed information about which policies were successfully applied and any errors that occurred.

## 8. ❓ Troubleshooting Group Policy Deployment

If Group Policy settings are not being applied, use gpresult, gpupdate, and Event Viewer to identify and troubleshoot the issues. It’s important to ensure correct GPO links and security filtering are in place.
