# 🌐 Network Security Configuration

This section outlines the configuration of network security settings to protect the network infrastructure from unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. 🔐 Configuring Network Security Policies

Define network security policies that restrict the flow of unauthorized traffic between network segments. These policies can include settings for network isolation, IP filtering, and the management of network interfaces.

## 2. 🔑 Configuring IPsec Policies for Encryption

Use IPsec policies to encrypt traffic between machines and protect sensitive data from being intercepted. This configuration is essential for securing communication over untrusted networks.

## 3. 📶 Configuring Network Access Protection (NAP)

Implement Network Access Protection (NAP) to enforce health policies on client machines, ensuring they meet security standards before granting network access. NAP is an essential tool for maintaining network security.

## 6. 📡 Configuring Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Security

Secure DHCP settings to prevent unauthorized devices from receiving IP addresses on the network. This can include the use of DHCP snooping and IP address filtering.

## 7. ⚙️ Configuring DNS Security

Configure DNS Security settings to protect against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks. This includes the use of DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) and secure forwarding.

## 8. 🚨 Reviewing Network Security Event Logs

Check Event Viewer for logs related to network security events, such as blocked connections or failed login attempts. This helps in identifying potential security issues early.

## 9. 🧪 Testing Network Security Configuration

Test the security configuration by simulating an attack, such as an unauthorized network connection or an attempt to bypass IPsec policies. Use tools like Wireshark or Nmap for testing.
