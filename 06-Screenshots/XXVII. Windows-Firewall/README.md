# üîí Windows Firewall Configuration

This section demonstrates the configuration of Windows Firewall settings within the Active Directory environment to enhance system security and manage network traffic.

---

## 1. üõ°Ô∏è Configuring Windows Firewall via Group Policy

Use Group Policy to configure Windows Firewall settings across the domain. You can define rules for inbound and outbound traffic, specify exceptions, and manage the firewall settings for all computers within the domain.

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring Firewall Rules for Specific Applications

Configure inbound and outbound rules for specific applications to control network access. This allows for enhanced security by restricting unnecessary traffic while allowing required applications to function.
