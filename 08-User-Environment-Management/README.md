## 🗂️ Mapped Network Drives

### Description
I configured a GPO to automatically map specific network drives based on a user's organizational unit (OU). This ensures that users have access to the correct shared resources without needing to configure anything manually.

### Drives Created
- **S:** Home directory (mapped to personal user folder)
- **Z:** Shared Department folder (based on department OU)
