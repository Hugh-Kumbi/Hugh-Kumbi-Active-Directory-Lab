## üîß 3. Logon Script Functionality
The PowerShell logon script performs the following actions when a user logs in to the **hughdomain.local domain:**

1. **User Notification**
 * Displays a popup notification indicating the logon script is running
 * Shows a completion message when finished
2. **Logging & Auditing**
 * Records logon events to a centralized log file (`\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\LogFiles\<USERNAME>-logon.log`)
 * Logs timestamp, username, and source computer for each logon
3. **Drive Mapping**
 * Maps persistent Z: drive to `\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\SharedDocs`
 * Includes error handling and logging for drive mapping failures
 * Removes existing Z: drive mappings before reconnection
4. **User Folder Management**
 * Creates personalized folders in `\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\UserFolders\<USERNAME>` if they don't exist
5. **Outlook Signature Deployment**
 * Copies user-specific Outlook signatures from a network template location to the local Signatures folder

üíª **Example: `LogonScript.ps1`**

```
# PowerShell Logon Script for hughdomain.local
# Save as LogonScript.ps1 in \\hughdomain.local\SYSVOL\hughdomain.local\scripts\

# Display notification to user
$wshell = New-Object -ComObject Wscript.Shell
$wshell.Popup("Logon script is running. Please wait...", 5, "Domain Logon Script", 0x0 + 0x40)

# Log the logon event
$LogPath = "\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\LogFiles\$env:USERNAME-logon.log"
$LogMessage = "$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') - User $env:USERNAME logged on from computer $env:COMPUTERNAME"
Add-Content -Path $LogPath -Value $LogMessage
```

## üîå 3.1  Logoff Script Functionality
The PowerShell logoff script executes the following when a user logs off:

1. **User Notification**
 * Displays a popup notification indicating the logoff process has started
2. **Logging & Auditing**
 * Records logoff events to `\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\LogFiles\<USERNAME>-logoff.log`
 * Tracks timestamp, username, and source computer
3. **Resource Cleanup**
 * Safely disconnects mapped Z: drive
 * Clears temporary files from `%TEMP%`
4. **User Data Backup**
 * Performs incremental backup of key folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures) to the user's network folder
 * Only copies new or modified files to optimize performance
 * Maintains original folder structure during backup
5. **Session Termination**
 * Attempts to display a completion notification (may not appear if logoff is rapid)
 * Logs final completion timestamp

üíª **Example: `LogoffScript.ps1`**

```
# PowerShell Logoff Script for hughdomain.local
# Save as LogoffScript.ps1 in \\hughdomain.local\SYSVOL\hughdomain.local\scripts\

# Display notification to user
$wshell = New-Object -ComObject Wscript.Shell
$wshell.Popup("Logoff script is running. Please wait...", 5, "Domain Logoff Script", 0x0 + 0x40)

# Log the logoff event
$LogPath = "\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\LogFiles\$env:USERNAME-logoff.log"
$LogMessage = "$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') - User $env:USERNAME logged off from computer $env:COMPUTERNAME"
Add-Content -Path $LogPath -Value $LogMessage
```

### ‚úÖ 4. Testing and Validation

To validate the script:
1. Ensured the files were placed in the `\\hughdomain.local\SysVol\hughdomain.local\Policies\{FA47D7AB-C6A5-4898-9D72-3C0AE53F0246}\User` shared folder.
2. Logged in as a domain user.
3. Verified:
  * Welcome message displayed
  * Z: drive mounted
  * Log file created
