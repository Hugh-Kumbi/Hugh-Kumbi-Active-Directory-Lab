# üîÅ Logon/Logoff Scripts via Group Policy

In this section, I configured logon scripts using Group Policy to automate specific actions when users log into the domain. These scripts enhance user experience, enforce configurations, and streamline administrative tasks.

## üìÇ 3. Script Contents

Here‚Äôs an example of what my `LogonScript.ps1` included:

```powershell
# LogonScript.ps1
# PowerShell Logon Script for hughdomain.local
# Save as LogonScript.ps1 in `\\hughdomain.local\SYSVOL\hughdomain.local\scripts\`

# Display notification to user
$wshell = New-Object -ComObject Wscript.Shell
$wshell.Popup("Logon script is running. Please wait...", 5, "Domain Logon Script", 0x0 + 0x40)

# Log the logon event
$LogPath = "\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\LogFiles\$env:USERNAME-logon.log"
$LogMessage = "$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') - User $env:USERNAME logged on from computer $env:COMPUTERNAME"
Add-Content -Path $LogPath -Value $LogMessage"
```
The script creates a message on the user's desktop after logging in.

Here‚Äôs an example of what my `LogoffScript.ps1` included:

```powershell
# LogoffScript.ps1
# PowerShell Logoff Script for hughdomain.local
# Save as LogoffScript.ps1 in `\\hughdomain.local\SYSVOL\hughdomain.local\scripts\`

# Display notification to user
$wshell = New-Object -ComObject Wscript.Shell
$wshell.Popup("Logoff script is running. Please wait...", 5, "Domain Logoff Script", 0x0 + 0x40)

# Log the logoff event
$LogPath = "\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\LogFiles\$env:USERNAME-logoff.log"
$LogMessage = "$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') - User $env:USERNAME logged off from computer $env:COMPUTERNAME"
Add-Content -Path $LogPath -Value $LogMessage
```
The script creates a message on the user's desktop after logging off.

## üß™ 4. Testing the Script
**Logon Script Verification:**

1. Logged in to hughdomain.local as a standard domain user

2. Observed the following automated behaviors:

   * ‚úîÔ∏è "Logon script is running" notification appeared (5-second timeout)

   * ‚úîÔ∏è Z: drive successfully mapped to `\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\SharedDocs`

   * ‚úîÔ∏è User folder created at `\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\UserFolders\<username>` (if first logon)

   * ‚úîÔ∏è Outlook signatures deployed (if template existed for user)

   * ‚úîÔ∏è Completion notification displayed

3. Verified log file creation at:
   * `\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\LogFiles\<username>-logon.log`

   * Confirmed timestamp, username, and computer name were recorded

   * Checked success/failure messages for all operations

**Logoff Script Verification:**

1. Initiated logoff sequence

2. Confirmed:

   * ‚úîÔ∏è "Logoff script is running" notification appeared

   * ‚úîÔ∏è Z: drive was automatically disconnected

   * ‚úîÔ∏è User data (Desktop/Documents/Pictures) backed up to network folder

   * ‚úîÔ∏è Temporary files cleared from %TEMP%

3. Verified logoff entry in:
   `\\WIN-D2PQBCI88JQ\LogFiles\<username>-logoff.log`

Logoff notification popup (if captured before session termination)

üîç **Validation Checklist:**

* All users receive consistent drive mappings

* Log files are writable by standard users

* Backup process preserves file structure/permissions

* No errors in PowerShell event logs (`Win+R ‚Üí eventvwr.msc`)
