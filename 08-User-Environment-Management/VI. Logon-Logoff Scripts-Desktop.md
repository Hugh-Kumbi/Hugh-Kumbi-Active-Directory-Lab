# üîÅ Logon/Logoff Scripts via Group Policy

In this section, I configured logon scripts using Group Policy to automate specific actions when users log into the domain. These scripts enhance user experience, enforce configurations, and streamline administrative tasks.

## üìÇ 3. Script Contents

Here‚Äôs an example of what my `LogonScript.ps1` included:

``` powershell
# LogonScript.ps1
# Location: \\hughdomain.local\NETLOGON\LogonScript.ps1
# (Which points to C:\WINDOWS\SYSVOL\sysvol\hughdomain.local\SCRIPTS\LogonScript.ps1)

# ----- CONFIGURATION -----
$ServerName = "WINSERVER2025"
$ServerIP = "192.168.1.10"
$LogLocations = @(
    "\\$ServerIP\LogFiles\$env:USERNAME-logon.log",
    "\\$ServerName\LogFiles\$env:USERNAME-logon.log",
    "C:\Windows\Temp\Logs\$env:USERNAME-logon.log"
)

# ----- INITIALIZATION -----
# Create local log directory if needed
if (-not (Test-Path "C:\Windows\Temp\Logs")) {
    New-Item -Path "C:\Windows\Temp\Logs" -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null
}

```
The script creates a message on the user's desktop after logging in.

Here‚Äôs an example of what my `LogoffScript.ps1` included:
```
# LogoffScript.ps1 for hughdomain.local
# Save to: \\hughdomain.local\NETLOGON\LogoffScript.ps1

# ----- CONFIGURATION -----
$ServerName = "WINSERVER2025"
$ServerIP = "192.168.1.10"
$LogLocations = @(
    "\\$ServerIP\LogFiles\$env:USERNAME-logoff.log",
    "\\$ServerName\LogFiles\$env:USERNAME-logoff.log",
    "C:\Windows\Temp\Logs\$env:USERNAME-logoff.log"
)

# ----- INITIALIZATION -----
# Create local log directory if needed
if (-not (Test-Path "C:\Windows\Temp\Logs")) {
    New-Item -Path "C:\Windows\Temp\Logs" -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null
}

```
The script creates a message on the user's desktop after logging off.

## üß™ 4. Testing the Script

**Logon Script Verification:**

1. Logged in to hughdomain.local as a standard domain user
2. Observed the following automated behaviors:
   * ‚úîÔ∏è "Logon script is running" notification appeared (5-second timeout)
   * ‚úîÔ∏è Z: drive successfully mapped to `\\WINSERVER2025\ITSecurity Shared Drive`
   * ‚úîÔ∏è S: drive successfully mapped to `\\WINSERVER2025\DepartmentalShares`
   * ‚úîÔ∏è User folder created at `\\WINSERVER2025\FileShares$\<username>` (if first logon)
   * ‚úîÔ∏è Outlook signatures deployed (if template existed for user)
   * ‚úîÔ∏è Completion notification displayed
3. Verified log file creation at:
   * `\\WINSERVER2025\LogFiles\<username>-logon.log`
   * Confirmed timestamp, username, and computer name were recorded
   * Checked success/failure messages for all operations

**Logoff Script Verification:**

1. Initiated logoff sequence
2. Confirmed:
   * ‚úîÔ∏è "Logoff script is running" notification appeared
   * ‚úîÔ∏è Z: drive was automatically disconnected
   * ‚úîÔ∏è S: drive was automatically disconnected
   * ‚úîÔ∏è User data (Desktop/Documents/Pictures) backed up to network folder
   * ‚úîÔ∏è Temporary files cleared from %TEMP%

3. Verified logoff entry in:
   `\\WINSERVER2025\LogFiles<username>-logoff.log`
