# üîÅ Logon/Logoff Scripts via Group Policy

In this section, I configured logon scripts using Group Policy to automate specific actions when users log into the domain. These scripts enhance user experience, enforce configurations, and streamline administrative tasks.

## üìÇ 3. Script Contents

Here‚Äôs an example of what my `logonScript.ps1` included:

```powershell
# logonScript.ps1
New-Item -Path "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Desktop" -Name "Welcome.txt" -ItemType File -Force
Add-Content -Path "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Desktop\Welcome.txt" -Value "Welcome to HughDomain!"
```
The script creates a welcome message on the user's desktop after logging in.

## üß™ 4. Testing the Script
1. Logged in to the domain as a regular user.

2. Verified that Welcome.txt was automatically created on the desktop.

3. Confirmed the contents were accurate and permissions were correct.

üì∏ **Screenshot suggestions:**

- User desktop showing `Welcome.txt` file

- Opened file showing the welcome message
