# 🖼️ Desktop Wallpaper Policy

This section explains how I implemented a **Desktop Wallpaper Policy** using Group Policy to enforce a consistent desktop background across all user machines in the domain. This helps standardize branding and minimizes distractions in a corporate environment.

## ✅ 3. Testing and Results

To test the policy:
1. Logged into a domain-joined client machine as a standard user.
2. Verified that the desktop wallpaper was automatically applied.
3. Attempted to change the wallpaper via settings — confirmed that the option was greyed out.
