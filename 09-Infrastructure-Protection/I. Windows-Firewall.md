# üî• Windows Firewall Group Policy Configuration
In this section, I configured Windows Firewall rules using Group Policy to ensure consistent network protection across all domain-joined machines. The firewall was enforced for all profiles‚ÄîDomain, Private, and Public‚Äîusing secure inbound/outbound rules.

## üìã 3. Custom Firewall Rules
Created custom inbound rules to allow:
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** for Domain Admins
- **File and Printer Sharing**
- Blocked  **SMBv1** services
- Blocked **Unencrypted FTP** services
- Blocked **TFTP** services
- Blocked **Telnet** services

Steps:
1. Navigated to `Inbound Rules` > New Rule  
2. Chose Port or Program-based rules  
3. Configured action as **Block** or **Allow**, with appropriate scope and user/group restrictions  
4. Named and saved each rule

## üß™ 4. Testing Firewall Behavior
- Verified that only allowed services could be accessed remotely.
- Confirmed that non-domain machines could not connect to domain resources unless allowed.
- Used `netsh advfirewall show allprofiles` to verify profile settings on clients.
