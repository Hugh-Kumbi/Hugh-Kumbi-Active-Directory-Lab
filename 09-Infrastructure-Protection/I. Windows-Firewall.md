# üî• Windows Firewall Group Policy Configuration

This document outlines how I configured **inbound and outbound firewall rules via Group Policy** to ensure that essential Active Directory services are permitted while blocking insecure or unnecessary protocols.

## üè∑Ô∏è 1. GPO Name

- **GPO Name:** Windows Firewall Settings Policy  
- **Linked To:** hughdomain.local (domain root)

## üîß 2. Inbound Firewall Rule Configuration

I created multiple **inbound rules** for Active Directory communication services using:

üìÇ `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security > Inbound Rules`

## üöÄ 4. Applying and Testing the Policy

I closed the Group Policy Management Editor
- On each client computer, I ran the following command:

  `gpupdate /force`
  
- Then I restarted the clients to ensure the policy was fully applied
- I tested connectivity between the domain controller and the clients

### üß™ 5. Testing Firewall Behavior

- On client computers, I opened Command Prompt as administrator and ran:

## üõ†Ô∏è 6. Troubleshooting Tips

- Temporarily disabled the firewall to determine if it was blocking connectivity
- Used `rsop.msc` to confirm policy inheritance on client machines
- Checked **Event Viewer** for related errors
- Ran:
  `netsh advfirewall monitor show firewall rule name=all`
- To see all applied firewall rules and check for any misconfiguration
