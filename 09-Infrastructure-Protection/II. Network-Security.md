## üß™ 3. Verification and Testing

- Ran `gpupdate /force` on client machines to apply policies immediately.
- Used `secpol.msc` and `gpresult /h` to verify effective policy settings.
- Attempted legacy connections to confirm they were blocked or upgraded to NTLMv2.

üì∏ **Screenshot:**
- PowerShell or command prompt output of gpresult showing policy enforcement
