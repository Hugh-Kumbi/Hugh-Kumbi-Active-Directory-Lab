# üåê Network Security Configuration via GPO

In this section, I implemented secure network communication policies across all domain-joined systems to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. These settings help defend against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and enforce strong authentication protocols.

## üß™ 3. Verification and Testing

- Ran `gpupdate /force` on client machines to apply policies immediately.
- Used `secpol.msc` and `gpresult /h` to verify effective policy settings.
- Attempted legacy connections to confirm they were blocked or upgraded to NTLMv2.
