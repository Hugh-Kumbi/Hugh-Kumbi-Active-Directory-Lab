# 🔧 WSUS-Configuration

  ## 🔍 Overview

In this section of my Active Directory lab, I configured **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)** on **Windows Server 2025** to centrally manage updates for domain-joined Windows 11 clients. This setup ensures that updates are controlled, approved, and deployed consistently across the network, which is crucial for system stability, compliance, and security.

### 4. 🖥️ Configure Group Policy for WSUS Clients

Using **Group Policy Management**, I created and linked a GPO to apply WSUS settings to my domain-joined Windows 11 clients:

- GPO Name: `WSUS Client Configuration`

  `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update`

**Settings:**
- **Specify intranet Microsoft update service location:**  
  `http://<WSUS-Server-IP>:8530`

### 5. 🔄 Force Group Policy Update and Confirm Client Detection

On both Windows 11 clients:

- Ran `gpupdate /force` from Command Prompt
- Checked Windows Update registry entries using `regedit` to confirm WSUS configuration
- Used the following PowerShell command to confirm the client was detected by WSUS:

```powershell
Get-WindowsUpdateLog
```

Verified clients appeared under Computers in WSUS Console
