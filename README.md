# 🛡️ Active Directory Home Lab - Windows Server 2025

Welcome to my Active Directory (AD) Home Lab, designed to simulate a small enterprise network using **Windows Server 2025** and **Windows 11 Pro** clients. This lab provides hands-on experience with deploying and managing AD, DNS, GPOs, and security policies in a virtualized environment using VirtualBox.
