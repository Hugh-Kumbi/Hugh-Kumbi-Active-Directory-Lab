# 🛡️ Active Directory Home Lab - Windows Server 2025

Welcome to my Active Directory (AD) Home Lab, designed to simulate a small enterprise network using **Windows Server 2025** and **Windows 11 Pro** clients. This lab provides hands-on experience with deploying and managing AD, DNS, GPOs, and security policies in a virtualized environment using VirtualBox.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Set up a Windows Server 2025 Domain Controller
- Configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Join Windows 11 clients to the domain
- Implement Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for user and system management
- Enforce domain-level security policies (passwords, lockouts, audits)
- Troubleshoot and document common issues
- Practice infrastructure hardening and endpoint protection
